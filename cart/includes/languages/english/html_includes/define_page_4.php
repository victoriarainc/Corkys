                    <p>Each participant takes an order form around
                    to friends, family, and neighbors. Payments are
                    collected as orders are taken. Depending on the

                    should be sufficient for collecting orders.
                    After the forms have been turned in to Corky's
                    Kettle Corn, the orders will be popped fresh,
                    filled, and returned to you by the scheduled
                    delivery and/or pick-up date. Please deliver
                    within a few days to ensure freshness.</p>
